### Analyzing HEC-HMS and HEC-RAS output: part of the AutoHEC package ###
Code repository for automation scripts related to the Metropolitan Water
Reclamation District of Greater Chicago Watershed Release Rate project
at the Illinois State Water Survey (2015-2016).
  *Developed using Python 2.7.11, HEC-HMS 3.5, HEC-RAS 4.0, and HEC-DSSVue 2.0.1
  *Creator(s): Nicole JS Gaynor, ISWS
  *Technical documentation in AutoHEC/src/Analysis/README.txt


## Purpose ##
The Compare_*.py scripts were developed to compare two model versions of HEC-HMS
and HEC-RAS. It is used both to test the automation code in AutoHEC against
a manual version of the same model run and to compare multiple automated
versions of the model (with different release rates, redevelopment rates,
etc.) to assess the effect of each of these factors.

HEC_Inundation.py is somewhat different in that it uses a single model
run and calculates the duration and max depth of water over the lower bank
station at each river station. It is currently not set up to compare model
automatically. Data is output into a CSV file for easy processing elsewhere
or viewing in Excel.


## How to run code that calculates time and depth of inundation ##
1. Modify HEC_Inundation_Config.py to find the files and data addresses
   for the stage time series, max stage elevation, and max stage time.
   **When preparing the bank station elevations file, do not include
   Node Names in the table (under Options menu in the Profile Output
   Table of HEC-RAS).**
2. Open Windows Command Prompt.
3. Change to directory containing runInitHMS.cmd (AutoHEC/src/Analysis)
   directory ("dir" lists directory contents and "cd" changes directory).
4. Type "runHEC_Inundation.cmd" into the Windows command line and press Enter.
   Output will be saved to HEC_Inundation_output.txt.
